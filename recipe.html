        <h1>Recipe: No Bake Oreo Cheesecake</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">I have made this recipe quite a few times this year and it has really been a hit - especially among family parties, since one of my cousin's children is allergic to eggs, nuts, <i>and</i> peanuts. It is much simpler to make than a regular cheesecake and tastes no different!</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>I have made this with both using a food processor to create the Oreo crumbs and crumbing them manually with a regular kitchen knife and cutting board and found that I prefer the latter. While the food processor definitely saves time, I find that it is far too easy to overdo it, making the crumbs too finely milled. Once incorporated into the cheesecake, it gives it more of a "muddy" appearance rather than that of an Oreo cheesecake.</p>
        <p>I have also made this using a premade Oreo crust from the grocery store (for the sake of convenience) and have found that there is always extra filling if you use this size of a crust. In that event, I have done two things with the extra filling - 1) stored it in a tupperware in the freezer for a cheesecake-like "ice cream," and 2) made mini Oreo cheesecakes in a muffin tin. For the mini cheesecakes, I went ahead and prepared a small amount of Oreo crust (using the Oreos and butter), pressed it into the bottom of cupcake liners, and then filled the rest of the liner with the cheesecake mixture and Oreo topping. Using a large muffin tin produced three mini Oreo cheesecakes.</p>
